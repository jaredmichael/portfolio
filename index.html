            <h2>Get to know me</h2>
            <p>I am a recent graduate of the Full Stack Development bootcamp at Thinkful.
                I enjoy coding because I am great at solving problems and I love seeing 
                project ideas come to fruition on the screen.  
                
                I am an active and social one.  I love being outdoors and getting sand 
                under my feet. I travel the world when I can and learning about new 
                cultures and their eats make me all giddy inside. Most of all I love 
                basketball and can escape into a court induced euphoria with a ball in 
                my hand.  I believe life is lived to learn and become your best self and
                I enjoy the process of this principle everyday.</p>
